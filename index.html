Since I was young I have loved taking apart and reassembling things to understand how they work. Now, this passion has become my job: the step from Lego to software development was a short one. Finding the best possible solution so that a complex system can work at its best and making it run smoothly are the goals of my work. C#, WCF, ESB, MongoDb and Azure make up my survival toolkit and help me cruise through distributed systems and enterprise solutions with ease. Be it a command or an event, I try to do my best in contributing to the life of the communities that have adopted me (ugidotnet and WEBdeBS), trying to &#8220;give back&#8221; at least a part of what I have received over these years.</p></div><div class=team-member-picture><div class=instructions><span>Tap to start transformation!</span></div><div class=normal-container><img class=img-responsive src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/ale-550.png alt=""></div><img class="img-responsive superhero" src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/ale-super-550.png alt=""></div></article></div><div class=team-member-container><article class=team-member><div class="team-member-picture hidden-sm hidden-xs"><div class=normal-container><img class=img-responsive src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/ema-550.png alt=""></div><img class="img-responsive superhero" src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/ema-super-550.png alt=""></div><div class=team-member-content><header><h1>Emanuele @emadb</h1><h2>Emanuele Del Bono</h2><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a href=https://twitter.com/emadb>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=http://www.linkedin.com/in/emanueledb>Linkedin</a></li><li><a href=http://www.slideshare.net/emadb>Slideshare</a></li><li><a href=http://www.github.com/emadb>Github</a></li></ul></header><p>I am an architect and software developer with more than 10 years’ experience in building web applications. I have always been curious and interested in learning new technologies and new languages, and over the last few years I have spent my time in frontend development, taking in my stride the quirks of javascript and different browser personalities. C#, Ruby, Javascript, Test Driven Development, Patterns and Clean Code are the languages I speak every day. I love to share what I learn, actively participating in conferences as a speaker at numerous events for various developer communities. But I don’t just live for technology: in my spare time I really enjoy freshwater sailing on Lake Garda and being a “perfect dad”.</p></div><div class="team-member-picture visible-sm visible-xs"><div class=normal-container><img class=img-responsive src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/ema-550.png alt=""></div><img class="img-responsive superhero" src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/ema-super-550.png alt=""></div></article></div><div class=team-member-container><article class=team-member><div class=team-member-content><header><h1>Valeria @vleonardi</h1><h2>Valeria Leonardi</h2><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a href=https://twitter.com/vleonardi>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=http://www.linkedin.com/in/valerialeonardi>Linkedin</a></li><li><a href=http://www.slideshare.net/ValeriaLeonardi>Slideshare</a></li></ul></header><p>Geeky mum, music lover and clarinetist for more than ten years, I successfully share my time between my work and my two children.

After a brief Python development experience, I am now enthusiastic about developing mobile applications for Android.

My passion for computer science was born the first time I saw my older brother playing with his &#8220;Commodore 16&#8221;. I was very young and I didn&#8217;t understand the meaning of &#8220;insert and remove compact cassettes&#8221;, &#8220;load&#8221;, &#8220;return&#8221;, etc.. but it was so fascinating and it surely influenced me when, years later, I decided to study computer science. At the moment I mostly create back-end solution, I&#8217;m also very interested in distribution and scalability problems of software. I&#8217;ve been working for many years with C#, and lately I&#8217;ve become fond of NodeJs and specially of Erlang/Elixir. I think that open dialogue and knowledge sharing are the best way to learn from others and achieve personal growth together so I strongly believe in the community participation. In fact I&#8217;ve been coordinating the activities of “XPug Bologna” for several years and I’m involved with the organization of some italian conferences. Anyway the software world is not the only one for me: I&#8217;m a great basket fan, I love good food (if you want to make me happy bring me to a good restaurant) and long walks in the mountains.</p></div><div class="team-member-picture visible-sm visible-xs"><div class=normal-container><img class=img-responsive src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/paolo-550.png alt=""></div><img class="img-responsive superhero" src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/paolo-super-550.png alt=""></div></article></div><div class=team-member-container><article class=team-member><div class=team-member-content><header><h1>Luciano</h1><h2>Luciano Cauzzi</h2><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a href=https://it.linkedin.com/in/luciano-cauzzi-62b1268>Linkedin</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/speciosus84>Twitter</a></li></ul></header><p>I am a young fan of technology and innovation, atypical engineer, motivated to learn and grow my skills in computing. In the last three years I have been involved in the mobile application development for Android and iOs platforms. I chose this area because it gives me the opportunity to get into users&#8217; pockets, understand their needs and see how technology can improve every day&#8217;s life when used conscientiously. I think the comparison is a key part of &#8220;team life&#8221; in order to find solutions to face problems and find innovative solutions. In everyday life I&#8217;m a little bit crazy&#8230; I like to joke, run along Mincio and make experiments in the kitchen.</p></div><div class=team-member-picture><div class=normal-container><img class=img-responsive src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/luc-550.png alt=""></div><img class="img-responsive superhero" src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/luc-super-550.png alt=""></div></article></div><div class=team-member-container><article class=team-member><div class="team-member-picture hidden-sm hidden-xs"><div class=normal-container><img class=img-responsive src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/madda-550.png alt=""></div><img class="img-responsive superhero" src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/madda-super-550.png alt=""></div><div class=team-member-content><header><h1>Maddalena</h1><h2>Maddalena Germinario</h2><ul class="list-inline tags"><li><a href=https://twitter.com/10Madda>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/maddalena-germinario/67/628/111>Linkedin</a></li></ul></header><p>When I was a little girl, if someone asked me what I would want to be as a grown-up I used to answer &#8220;an engineer&#8221;.

I&#8217;m sure that the best is yet to come and so I face the daily challenges of my work willing to improve my skills and learn new things, also relying on the fruitful cooperation with the team.

I collaborate since over ten years as a teaching assistant with the University of Brescia, discovering and rediscovering that teaching is the best way to learn. I&#8217;m a passionate cyclist and a serial reader - from Divina Commedia to technical readings, from novels to the phone book - but the great passion of my life are &#8220;my women&#8221;: my wife and our wonderful daughters.</p></div><div class=team-member-picture><div class=normal-container><img class=img-responsive src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/pietro-550.png alt=""></div><img class="img-responsive superhero" src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/pietro-super-550.png alt=""></div></article></div><div class=team-member-container><article class=team-member><div class="team-member-picture hidden-sm hidden-xs"><div class=normal-container><img class=img-responsive src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/chiara-550.png alt=""></div><img class="img-responsive superhero" src=/images/ritratti-trasp-550/chiara-super-550.png alt=""></div><div class=team-member-content><header><h1>Chiara</h1><h2>Chiara Ghiselli</h2><ul class="list-inline tags"></ul></header><p>My background is based on classical studies.
